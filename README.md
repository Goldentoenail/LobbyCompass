# LobbyCompass
Vastly rewritten code for MC 1.9.x compatiblity

This should be compatible with MC versions from 1.8.0 onwards.

Caveats:
The alias /LC is also used by LegendChat - solution do not use this alias This may only affect ops.
WordEdit recognises any compass as it's navigation tool. This will only affect ops unless a player has been given the navigation tool permission.
